### Higgs

Higgs, the particle found in 2012 at the LHC, is one of the main problem in particle physics.

Beate Heinemann and Yosef Nir list 7 problems about Higgs [arXiv:1905.00382](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00382):
- Is Higgs the only scalar degree of freedom?
- Is Higgs elementary?
- What keeps m<sub>h</sub><sup>2</sup> << m<sub>Pl</sub><sup>2</sup> ?
- Was the electroweak phase transition first order?
- Did CP-violating Higgs intractions generate baryon asymmetry?
- Are there light SM-singlet degrees of freedom (in particular, related to Dark Matter)?
- What is the solution of flavor puzzle(s)?
