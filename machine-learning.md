# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a rapidly growing field with many application in physics. Here, I write about machine learning.
Currently, I don't have a specific plan to what to write on this page, thus I write what I find interesting.

## Machine Learning in Dark Matter

[Dark Machines](http://darkmachines.org/) is a new collaboration which wants to solve the mysteries of dark matter with data science and machine learning techniques.
There is an [indico](https://indico.cern.ch/category/10285/) page for Dark Machine collaboration. In addition, they have a twitter account [@dark_machines](https://twitter.com/dark_machines) posting related information.
