### How to start and gain skills for experimental particle physics?

Experimental particle physics (EPP) is a very broad field and it is impossible to excel everything in that. 
Here, I want to introduce materials which are necessary (in my point of view) for data analysis and programming in EEP.   

#### Step 0: English
There is no need to emphesize this skill. That's the one way you can start your research in 21<sup>st</sup> century.

#### Step 1: Unix
The very fist step, is to learn **Unix/Linux**.
I recommend the course [Unix workbench](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unix). You will get familiar with these subjects after this course:
- Unix commands, variables, directory structure, ...
- Bash programming
- Markdown
- Make
- Git
- Github
- Cloud computing    

This course is introductary, easy but extremely useful for beginners.

#### Step 2: Editor (Vim)
The next step, is to choose an editor to write codes. I have used many editors such as Nano, Vim, Text-editor, Notepad++, Emacs and Eclipse.

In my opinion, the best editor for EPP is **Vim**. 
For simple tasks related to operating system tasks the **Nano** is good choice, but for professional coding you need an advanced editor.

One thing about Vim is that, it is **NOT** easy at the beginning, so feel free to not like it first. Learn it gradually and slowly.

If I have time, I will record videos about Vim and post them on my You-tube channel.

For python codes, in addition to editor, you may want to use notebooks. I highly recommend **Jupyter Notebook** for python codes. Thanks to root-cern team, Jupyter notebook is now capable of writing C++ codes. Thus, for EPP the best notebook is Jupyter Notebook.

#### Step 3: Programming (C++ or Python)
As an experimental particle physicist you need to learn at least two languages which are
1- C++
2- Python

The C++ is harder to learn than Python. However, learning C++ will help you to understand the concepts of programming and computer deeply. Thus, my recommendation is to first learn C++ and master it. After that, you can learn Python in just one week.

**Warning:** The best way to learn programming is to do programming. Experiment with code always. Do not forget this fundamental principle.

Leaning C++ means being comfortable and excel this concepts and usage of them:   
- C++ input/output stream (`std::cout`, `std::cin`)
- C++ built-in data types (`int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `bool`, `string`)
- Variables (global, local, type, name, value, size, memory)
- Functions (return type, parameters, arguments)
- Iteration (`for` loops especially)
- Logical expressions (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- Conditions (`if` statements)
- Arrays and Pointers
- Container in C++ (`vector` container)
- Structure of the code in C++ (header `.h` and source `.C` or `.cpp` files) 
- Struct (user-defined data types)
- Class(user-defined data types + methods (functions to operate on data members) )
- Object Oriented Programming (begin able to solve problems with defining appropriate classed and creating objects from those classes)
- Class Inheritance (This one is very useful in EPP)
- Errors (It is important to be familiar with errors to debug the code and make it to do the write thing)
- Learn concepts to be able to search in the Web for your questions (in programming you always search for your problems, you need to know fundamentals to be able to use materials which are available in the Web)


The are many videos for elementary and advanced C++ learning. In [edx](https://www.edx.org/learn/c-plus-plus), there are courses for C++ provided by the Microsoft, but I have not tried them.
I have watched videos from [Infinite Skills](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-c/9781926873411/) and [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/C-training-tutorials/1250-0.html) for C++. The video from [Infinite Skills](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-c/9781926873411/) is very useful for beginners.


#### Step 4: Statistics

#### Step 5: Particle Physics and Collider Physics

#### Step 6: Detector Physics (CMS)
Detector physics is a broad subject by itself. Here I want to give links which are useful for **CMS** detector.
