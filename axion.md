### Axions and Axion-like Particles (ALPs)

Axion are first proposed as a solution for Strong CP problem, but nowadays they are more than that. Axions are pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons of a broken global symmetry. They have two parameters: mass and axion decay constant. However, mass is not an independent parameter, and it is a function of axion decay constant. Axion-like particles are generalization of axions in which the mass and decay constant are two independent parameters.

There are many motivation to study ALPs. Some of them are:
- ALPs can be dark matter candidates
- ALPs are generic prediction of many high energy physics models with a spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry
- ALPs appear in low energy effective filed theories of string theory
